***AI Recipe Generator*** 

An AI-powered recipe assistant where users can enter the ingredients they have (e.g., "tomato, rice, onion") and instantly get creative recipes with clear cooking steps.

Bonus features include:

Healthy Version → Suggests a lighter/healthier alternative.

5-Minute Version → Suggests a super quick recipe with minimal steps.

***Project Overview***

Cooking can be fun, but often we don’t know what to make with the ingredients we have at home. This project solves that by using AI to generate recipes based on available ingredients.

The app will:

Take user input (list of ingredients).

Generate recipe suggestions with detailed steps.

Provide optional variations:

Healthy Option (low oil, high nutrition).

Quick Option (fast to prepare in ~5 minutes).

***Tech Stack***

Frontend: React.js (or Streamlit for a quick prototype UI)

Backend / API: Python (FastAPI / Flask)

AI Model: Hugging Face / OpenAI API (for recipe generation)

Database (Optional): SQLite / MongoDB (for saving history or favorites)
